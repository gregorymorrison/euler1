[Lua](http://www.lua.org/), introduced in 1993, is renowned for its accessibility and simplicity; it's used primarily as an embedded scripting language. It's supposed to be highly optimized for speed.

My version of [Euler1](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1) here is straight out of the imperative school - it looks just like [JavaScript](http://gdm9000.wordpress.com/2011/10/15/javascript/), [Java](http://gdm9000.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/305/), [VBScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript)... It's so familiar that it literally took me only 15 minutes to bang this out with no prior knowledge of this language. It's actually disappointingly verbose for what it is, but I can't complain about the development time:

```lua
#!/usr/bin/lua5.3
-- Euler1 in Lua

function euler(n)
    local retval = 0
    for i = 0, n do
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0 then
            retval = retval + i
        end
    end
    return retval
end

print (string.format("Euler1 = %d", euler1(999)))
```

Here's a functional version that uses [tail recursion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion) with an accumulator. One of the main points here is that the function _euler()_ is [deterministic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm) - it will always return the same output for a given input. This is accomplished in part by the absence of any variable manipulation - there are instead only functions which return values. The other main point is that this recursion uses [tail call optimization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310974/what-is-tail-call-optimization) - it's written in such a way that an intelligent compiler can optimize its stack usage to be [_O(n) instead of O(n!)_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). In English, this means that your program will probably not crash even for hugely recursive calls.

```lua
#!/usr/bin/lua5.3
-- Euler1 in Lua

function euler(n, acc)
    if n == 1 then
        return acc
    end
    if n%3 == 0 || n%5 == 0
        return euler(n-1, acc+n)
    end
    return euler(n-1, acc)
end

function euler1(n)
    return euler(n, 0)
end

print (string.format("Euler1 = %d", euler1(999)))
```

Here¿s [one more](http://blog.smoothfriction.nl/archive/2011/01/23/powershell-fun-project-euler-1-gauss-being-smart.aspx) ¿ an elegant algorithm based on an observation by little Carl Friedrich Gauss. It operates in [O(1) constant time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity). Don¿t sweat it if this seems inscrutable; click the blog link above for an explanation.

```lua
#!/usr/bin/lua5.3
-- Euler1 in Lua

function euler(n, size)
	return (math.floor(size/n)^2 + math.floor(size/n)) * n / 2 
end

function euler1(n)
	return euler(3, n) + euler(5, n) - euler(15, n)
end

print (string.format("Euler1 = %d", euler1(999)))
```

I look forward to investigating this language further. To install on Ubuntu, _apt-get install lua5.3_. Then to execute:

```bash
$ chmod +x euler1.lea
$ ./euler1.lua
233168
```
