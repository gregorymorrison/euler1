[Julia](http://julialang.org/), a new language introduced in 2011(?), attempts to be a high-level, high-performance scientific computing platform. It was inspired by [Matlab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlab) and extended with features from other modern languages - [Lisp](https://github.com/gregorymorrison/euler1/wiki/Lisp), [Perl](https://github.com/gregorymorrison/euler1/wiki/Perl), [Python](https://github.com/gregorymorrison/euler1/wiki/Python), [Ruby](https://github.com/gregorymorrison/euler1/wiki/Ruby), [Lua](https://github.com/gregorymorrison/euler1/wiki/Lua). So, along with having first-class functions, regular expressions, and multiple dispatch, it has built-in libraries for linear algebra, combinatorics, and signal processing. The runtime also transparently optimizes your process across multiple cores when it makes sense.

Here's a simple imperative version of [Euler1](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1). It took me maybe 15 minutes to write this code - five minutes to get the syntax, and ten minutes to make sense of the cryptic compiler errors. Note the return value is simply the value of the last line of a function:

```julia
# Euler1 in Julia

function euler1(n)
    result = 0
    for i = 1:n
        if i%3 == 0 || i%5 == 0
            result += i 
        end
    end
    result
end

println("euler1 = $(euler1(999))")
```

Here's a functional version that uses [tail recursion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion) with an accumulator. One of the main points here is that the function _euler()_ is [deterministic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm) - it will always return the same output for a given input. This is accomplished in part by the absence of any variable manipulation - there are instead only functions which return values. The other main point is that this recursion uses [tail call optimization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310974/what-is-tail-call-optimization) - it's written in such a way that an intelligent compiler can optimize its stack usage to be [_O(n) instead of O(n!)_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). In English, this means that your program will probably not crash even for hugely recursive calls.

```julia
# Euler1 in Julia

function euler(n, acc)
    if n == 1
        acc
    elseif n%3 == 0 || n%5 == 0
        euler(n-1, acc+n)
    else
        euler(n-1, acc)
    end
end

function Euler1(n)
    euler(n, 0)
end

println("euler1 = $(Euler1(999))")
```

Here's another version using a [Quicksort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)-based algorithm. Here we recursively break the list up in half and then reassemble it. Instead of sorting each half, though, we¿ll filter the pivot value, converting it to 0 if it¿s not divisible. Here, _euler()_ returns _euler()_ calculated on the half of the list before the pivot element, _euler()_ calculated on the half of the list after the pivot element, and the pivot element or 0, all added together. Note the [short-circuit conditional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) in the middle of that mess. Oddly, I couldn't get the right answer without defining the variables _pre_, _post_, and _i_, even though they are never manipulated. This code demonstrates Julia's range generation and array slicing. Arrays in Julia are 1-based. It also displays a string template, declared types, and implicit return values without the return keyword.

```julia
# Euler1 in Julia

function euler(L::Array)
    if length(L) == 0
        0
    else
        pivot = round(Int, length(L)/2) + 1
        pre =  euler( L[1:pivot-1] )
        post = euler( L[pivot+1:end] )
        i = (L[pivot]%3 == 0 || L[pivot]%5 == 0) ? L[pivot] : 0

        pre + i + post
    end
end

function euler1(size::Int)
    return euler( collect(1:size) )
end

println( "euler1 = $(euler1(999))" )
```

Julia's implementation of Functional programming puts a big smile on my face. It's so straightforward and clean, it couldn't really be any simpler. [First-class functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_functions), lambdas, map, filter, reduce... [everything in its right place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrpGhEVyrk0):

```julia
# Euler1 in Julia

myMap    = x -> x
myFilter = x -> x%3==0 || x%5==0
myReduce = (x,y) -> x+y

function euler1(n::Int)
    mapped = map(myMap, collect(1:n))
    filtered = filter(myFilter, mapped)
    reduce(myReduce, filtered)
end

println("euler1 = $(euler1(999))")
```

Julia has support for symmetric coroutines, a sort of producer/consumer paradigm. Producers are like lightweight threads that go to sleep when they are not executing. This is kind of a contrived example, but it shows how coroutines work. The main thread, _euler1()_, loops through the numbers from 1 to 1000. For each number, it calls the other thread, _euler()_, that has a function which takes a number and returns a result. The main thread blocks until the child thread returns. I know what you're thinking - that's a function, right? Well, a function would normally be implemented using a stack frame. This implementation uses a separate thread. Like I said, it's a trivial, contrived example:

```julia
# Euler1 in Julia

function euler(c::Channel)
    i = 0
    while true
        if i%3 ==0 || i%5 == 0
             put!(i) 
        end
        i += 1
    end
end

function euler1(n)
    task = Channel(euler)

    result = 0
    while true
        i = take!(task)
        if i >= n
            break
        end
        result += i
    end

   result
end

println("euler1 = $(euler1(1000))")
```

Here¿s [one more](http://blog.smoothfriction.nl/archive/2011/01/23/powershell-fun-project-euler-1-gauss-being-smart.aspx) ¿ an elegant algorithm based on an observation by little Carl Friedrich Gauss. It operates in [O(1) constant time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity). Don¿t sweat it if this seems inscrutable; click the blog link above for an explanation.

```julia
# Euler1 in Julia

function mySum(n::Int, size::Int)
    (floor(size/n)^2 + floor(size/n)) * n / 2
end

function euler1(size::Int)
    mySum(3, size) + mySum(5, size) - mySum(15, size)
end

println("euler1 = $(euler1(999))")
```

Julia has an online REPL that lets you can kick its tires without installing anything - http://julia.forio.com/repl.htm. It seems like a great idea, though I didn't have a lot of luck with it - it kept locking up on me. Instead, I opted to install it from source using these [directions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). The process was simple, though it took hours to compile on my netbook. I also tried simply downloading a compiled binary, which also worked fine, using the following simple instructions:

```bash
mkdir julia && cd julia
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.2/julia-1.2.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf julia-1.2.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo ln -s ./julia-1.2.0/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```

Update - those instructions were so last-century. Today, just install julia from the apt package manager:

```bash
apt install julia
```

To run your code, simply pass it as an argument to the runtime:

```bash
$ julia euler1.j
233168
$
```
